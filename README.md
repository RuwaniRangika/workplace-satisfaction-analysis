This project analyzes the Workplace Satisfaction Survey dataset. The goal is to examine various factors influencing employee satisfaction, such as gender, education, salary, and satisfaction with different aspects of their job (management, salary, work environment, etc.).
Key objectives of the analysis:
1.	Explore and visualize the distribution of key demographic variables like age and salary.
2.	Analyze the satisfaction levels across different job aspects (management, salary, colleagues, tasks).
3.	Investigate relationships between categorical variables, such as gender and satisfaction with management, to identify any significant patterns or dependencies.
4.	Provide actionable insights that can help improve overall workplace satisfaction based on the data findings.
The analysis includes:
•	Descriptive statistics and visualizations (histograms, boxplots, heatmaps).
•	Cross-tabulation and chi-square tests to analyze relationships between qualitative variables.
•	Recommendations for improving workplace satisfaction based on the findings.
